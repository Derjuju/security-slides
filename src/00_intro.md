# Asymmetric Encryption

**Asymmetric encryption** or **public-key cryptography** uses a separate key for
encryption and decryption.

Anyone can use the encryption key (public key) to encrypt a message.

However, decryption keys (private keys) are secret.

The most common asymmetric encryption algorithm is **RSA**.

# Symmetric Encryption

**Symmetric encryption** or **pre-shared key encryption** uses a single key to both
encrypt and decrypt data.

Both the sender and the receiver need the same key to communicate.

**The larger the key size, the harder the key is to crack**.

Popular symmetric algorithms: Blowfish, AES, Twofish.
